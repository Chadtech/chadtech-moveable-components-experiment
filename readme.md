# Chadtech Moveable Components Experiment

This is a remake of an old project I did called "ct-os" (www.ct-os.us), as in the Chadtech Operating System. Of course its not a real operating system, but it kind of looks like one in that you have different programs, you can save files, and theres a desktop and start bar.

One reason I remade ctos was I wanted to try practice abstracting window logic. Turns out to be pretty complicated.
